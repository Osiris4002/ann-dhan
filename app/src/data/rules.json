  "wheat": {
    "irrigation": "Irrigate wheat every 7‚Äì10 days depending on soil moisture. Ensure critical irrigation at crown root initiation, tillering, and grain filling stages.",
    "fertilizer": "Apply 20kg urea/acre at tillering stage. Use 40kg DAP and 20kg MOP/acre at sowing if soil test is not available.",
    "pest": "Common pests are aphids and stem rust. Spray neem oil 3% or recommended fungicide if infestation is severe."
  },

  "tomato": {
    "irrigation": "Irrigate tomato every 5‚Äì7 days. Avoid waterlogging; use drip irrigation if possible for better yield.",
    "fertilizer": "Apply 10 tons of farmyard manure per acre before planting. Use 75:40:25 NPK kg/acre in split doses for best results.",
    "pest": "Major pests include fruit borer and leaf curl. For fruit borer, spray neem oil 5ml/litre or use pheromone traps. For leaf curl, manage whiteflies with yellow sticky traps."
  },

  "paddy": {
    "irrigation": "Maintain 2‚Äì5 cm standing water till panicle initiation. Reduce water during grain ripening to avoid lodging.",
    "fertilizer": "Apply 10‚Äì12 tons of green manure or FYM per acre. Use 50:25:25 NPK kg/acre in three splits (basal, tillering, panicle initiation).",
    "pest": "Watch for brown planthopper, stem borer, and leaf folder. Apply tricho-cards or neem extract first. Use chemical sprays only if infestation is high."
  },

  "coconut": {
    "irrigation": "Irrigate coconut palms once in 7‚Äì10 days in summer. Mulching with dry leaves and husk conserves moisture.",
    "fertilizer": "Apply 500g urea, 320g SSP, and 1200g MOP per palm per year in two splits. Supplement with organic manure (20‚Äì25kg).",
    "pest": "Control rhinoceros beetle with neem cake in the crown. Use pheromone traps for red palm weevil. Regularly clean crown area."
  },

  "banana": {
    "irrigation": "Irrigate banana every 5‚Äì8 days in summer. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for uniform growth.",
    "fertilizer": "Apply 20kg FYM per pit at planting. Use 200:60:200 NPK g/plant in 3‚Äì4 splits along with micronutrients.",
    "pest": "Watch for banana stem borer and bunchy top virus. Remove affected plants and control aphids (virus carriers) using neem spray."
  },

  "black_pepper": {
    "irrigation": "Irrigate vines once in 7‚Äì10 days during dry months. Mulching helps conserve moisture.",
    "fertilizer": "Apply 10kg compost or cattle manure per vine yearly. Supplement with 50:50:150 NPK g/vine in two splits.",
    "pest": "Common problems: quick wilt and pollu beetle. Use Trichoderma mixed with neem cake for wilt. Spray neem oil against beetles."
  },

  "rubber": {
    "irrigation": "Rubber usually grows under rain-fed conditions. Irrigation may be given in nurseries or young plantations in summer.",
    "fertilizer": "Apply 12:6:6 NPK mixture at 225g/tree every 6 months for immature trees. Add organic manure annually.",
    "pest": "Leaf fall disease is common. Use Bordeaux mixture or copper fungicides as preventive spray before monsoon."
